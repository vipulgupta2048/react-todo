Hydrating my ReactJS skills with a simple Todo app just like React does when it sees static HTML. 

Lessons Re-learned: 

1. React workflows
2. Managing State
3. Handling events 
4. Pages, Components, Props, Children.
5. Hooks
6. Personal Opinions: Console logging is the best form of debugging and if you say otherwise then I can't help you
7. Using React Developer Tools to figure out state and events.
